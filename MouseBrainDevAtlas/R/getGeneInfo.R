# Install biomart bioconductor packages

# Save excel gene list (Feline's) file as csv (make sure only rows and columns are saved in the file).

# Read csv file into R

# load biomart, get gene ids and extract ensembl and chromosomes for each gene symbol

# write a function that takes any gene list of symbols and returns the corresponding ensembl ids and chromosomes (a character vector)
